Kanban is a popular **framework** used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work.

## Key Concepts in Kanban

- **Visualize Work**: Using a visual model of your work and workflow can stimulate conversations about improvement.
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Limiting WIP allows us to complete what we start and to focus on one item at a time.
- **Manage Flow**: The focus of Kanban is the smooth flow of work through the system.
- **Make Policies Explicit**: Kanban teams make their policies explicit so that there can be a shared understanding of how work is done.
- **Implement Feedback Loops**: Kanban teams implement feedback loops to drive evolutionary change and improvement.
- **Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally**: Kanban encourages small, incremental changes that stick.
