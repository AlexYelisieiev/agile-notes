Scrum is a **framework** within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

## Key Roles in Scrum

- **Product Owner**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.
- **Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
- **Development Team**: The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.

## Scrum Events

- **Sprint**: The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
- **Sprint Planning**: The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning.
- **Daily Scrum**: The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
- **Sprint Review**: A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

## Scrum Development Process

The Scrum development process is centered around the concept of Sprints, which are time-boxed iterations that last typically 2-4 weeks. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

### Pre-Sprint

- **Product Backlog Refinement**: The Product Owner, with help from the team, updates the Product Backlog by adding new items, reprioritizing existing items, or refining items for clarity and detail.

### Sprint Planning

- **What**: The team and Product Owner agree on the goal of the Sprint and select Product Backlog items that contribute to that goal.
- **How**: The team plans out how they will deliver the selected items, often by breaking them down into smaller tasks.

### Sprint Execution

- **Daily Scrum**: Each day, the team holds a 15-minute meeting to synchronize their work and plan for the next 24 hours.
- **Development Work**: The team works on the selected items, collaborating and integrating their work frequently.
- **Product Backlog Refinement**: The Product Owner and team refine the Product Backlog for future Sprints.

### Post-Sprint

- **Sprint Review**: The team and stakeholders inspect the work done during the Sprint and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The team inspects its process and creates a plan for improvements for the next Sprint.
