Lean Software Development (LSD) is a translation of lean manufacturing and lean IT principles and practices to the software development domain.

## Key Principles in LSD

- **Eliminate Waste**: Anything that does not add value to the customer is considered waste.
- **Build Quality In**: Quality is improved by finding and fixing mistakes as soon as they're introduced.
- **Create Knowledge**: Knowledge is created by first producing a simple solution, then iteratively improving it.
- **Defer Commitment**: Decisions are delayed as long as possible.
- **Deliver Fast**: The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration.
- **Respect People**: People should be treated like they are the most important resource.
- **Optimize the Whole**: The focus is on the entire value stream, not on individual parts.
