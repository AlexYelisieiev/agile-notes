# Agile Methodology

Agile is a **project management methodology** that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating. Agile is an iterative approach to work that helps teams deliver value faster and with fewer headaches. It seeks to go with the flow of inevitable change rather than work against it. Agile calls for collaborative cross-functional teams, and open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile.

It has [12 principles](Principles.md).

## Key Features of Agile

- **Iterative and Incremental**: Agile methodology is iterative because it allows for doing the software development in small parts at a time. It is incremental because it develops the software incrementally, i.e., features are added in each of these iterations.
- **Collaboration and Self-Organization**: Agile teams are self-organizing, with no team leader assigning tasks to team members. Instead, the whole team addresses the issues.
- **Time-Boxed Iterations**: Each iteration is time-boxed, usually to two weeks. An iteration involves all the tasks necessary to prepare the selected features for production: planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation.
