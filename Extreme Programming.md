Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

## Key Practices in XP

- **Pair Programming**: All code is written with two programmers at one machine.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Code is written to pass automated test cases before functionality is implemented.
- **Continuous Integration**: Code changes are integrated into the code base frequently to avoid "integration hell".
- **Refactoring**: Code is improved without changing its behavior to remove duplication, improve communication, simplify, or add flexibility.
- **Simple Design**: The design is kept as simple as possible. Unnecessary complexity and functionality are avoided.
